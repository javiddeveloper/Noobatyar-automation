# Changelog

## v1.1.0 — 2026-08-06

### mobile_owner
- Typed toasts: success/error/warning now render with distinct styling instead of every screen showing the same error-red toast. Settings and LastVisitors, which had no toast host at all, now surface their ViewModel error messages. Several actions (delete/complete/no-show/approve/reject/send-message in LastVisitors) previously succeeded with zero user feedback — they now confirm.
- Session-expired / rate-limit errors show an actual message instead of silently resetting app state.
- Home screen plan banners: replaced the auto-rotating carousel with manual swipe — each banner is now narrower than the screen so the next one peeks at the edge, plus a hint telling the user they can swipe. Auto-rotation was disorienting and skipped past banners before anyone could read them.
- Pull-to-refresh: fixed the resting indicator height being smaller than its own label text, which clipped the bottom of "در حال بروزرسانی…" under the page content after a release.
- About Us screen redesign: animated gradient hero card, and the "ارتباط با ما" social links moved from an uneven icon grid to a vertical list with handle text, redesigned icons (bale/eitaa/rubika/instagram/website) replacing heavy, illegible bitmap auto-traces.
- Version check now sends the real numeric `versionCode` instead of deriving one by stripping dots out of the version name (`"1.2.3"` → `123`).
- Release build config fixed: CI now builds `assembleProdRelease` (the `prod` flavor) explicitly, since the module gained a `local`/`prod` flavor split and the untargeted build was producing both and moving the APK output path.
- New: emergency notice banner (owner-configurable, shown to clients), tiered reminder delivery, SMS report screen with quota + status filtering, deposit-payment tracking on appointments, dashboard "completed" stat fixed to actually count completed appointments, appointment edit no longer blocks on the appointment's own occupied slot, list filters (date range / sort) now apply correctly after sync.

### front_client
- Home page (`/`) no longer lists every registered business unauthenticated; it's now a landing/promo page for the app itself, since `/` was never the real booking entry point (`/b/<code>` is).
- Emergency notice banner shown on business profile and booking pages when the owner has one enabled.
- Fixed a dark-theme color token (`--color-warning-tint`) missing from the dark media block.

### backend
- Emergency notice, reminder delivery, and SMS report endpoints/models.
- Deposit payment method + tracking code/payment reference now exposed on appointment serialization.

### tooling / docs
- Documented the `-Pbuildkonfig.flavor` requirement for local Android builds — building the `local` product flavor without this flag silently produces prod's `BASE_URL` instead of `10.0.2.2`.
- Local vs. production config separated for backend (`.env.local`) and mobile (Gradle flavors), documented in `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`.
